                        Nicholas Carrington is a strategic consultant with expertise in nonprofit performance management. He helps organizations develop and refine evidence-informed interventions as well as the systems needed to measure and improve their quality and effectiveness. He started Hip Hop IllumiNation based on the recognition that far too many young men of color grow up without formal or informal role models and that hip hop music serves as a powerful launching pad for meaningful conversations about adolescence and emerging adulthood.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                       Prior to founding Hip Hop IllumiNation, Nick served as Director of Data and Evaluation for the DC Promise Neighborhood Initiative. He was also a Senior Research Analyst at Child Trends. In addition, Nick has consulted for a number of youth serving nonprofits, including Youth Speaks, Save the Children, and Venture Philanthropy Partners. He’s served on numerous boards and advisory groups, including as board chair for Words, Beats, & Life, an arts-based education nonprofit that uses the elements of hip hop culture to promote skill building for youth and build cultural bridges internationally.

                        <br />
                        In his own words…
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        “Since I was an adolescent myself, I have always been interested in the types of relationships, environments, and opportunities that contribute to positive youth development. For nearly 20 years, all of my academic and professional endeavors have reflected this one fundamental passion. As a high school student, I spent summers as a youth camp counselor, providing enriching out of school experiences for younger students. In college, while studying psychology with an emphasis on adolescent development, I spent hundreds of hours tutoring incarcerated youth in Boston. Since then, I have worked as an educator with expelled and suspended youth, as a clinician with adjudicated youth and families, and as a third-party and internal evaluator exploring the influences that promote positive (and negative) development for children and youth. In each endeavor, I have maintained an orientation toward strengths-based approaches that seek to provide youth with appropriate conditions they need to thrive.”
